# Siomeow Legends

Siomeow Legends is a top-down, free-for-all deathmatch game that throws players into intense, fog-of-war combat, where the ultimate goal is survival. Set in randomized arenas filled with strategic hiding spots and unpredictable traps, players control fierce feline warriors, each fighting to be the last cat standing. Cats must fight, hide, and strategize their way through each round, competing for points to secure victory- and avoid becoming a siomai.
